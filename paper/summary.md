### rl\_future\_trading\_reward\_function.pdf

- directly output trade instead of prediction followed by a trade
- reward function maximizes cummulative returns aka money earned (can also be a problem, e.g. hold forever your currency) / I would like to introduce a penalty for holding on a currency too long
// this is an interesting idea
- explore discrete and continous action spaces / scale positions based on volatility 
    => high pos when low volatility
    => low pos when high volatility

- use technical indicators as state (I can play around with different states)
- reward function is complicated, but worth investigating more
- results very good all networks outperformed the market best with DQN
